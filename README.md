This Repository is focused on Named Entity Recognition (NER) using advanced models and data processing techniques. It features three key methods: a KNN model using Gensim for word embeddings, a Feed-Forward Network, and a competitive LSTM model. We addressed class imbalance in the competitive model using various approaches, such as under-sampling, over-sampling, and class-weight adjustments to optimize performance. All methodologies and their detailed implementations are thoroughly documented in the report included in this repository.
